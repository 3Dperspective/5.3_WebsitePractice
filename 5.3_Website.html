<h2>Puzzle Games<h2>
    <p style="font-size:medium" class="center-text">I really enjoy eating cheese and playing video games, and one of my favorite generes is that of the puzzle platformer. Puzzle games can range from incredibly simple, repettitive actions that don't require much brainpower,
        (think LEGO games by Traveller's Tales), to extremely advanced solutions which can sometimes require hours of thought and complex problem-solving. I love puzzle games, and out of the games
        I've played I have some favorites. Some of my favorite puzzle games are Portal 1&2, Manifold Garden, FEZ, and OneShot. </p>
